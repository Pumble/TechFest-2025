lego 130 motor adapter by michimartini on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4502864

Summary:
This adapts the ubiquitous 130-type motor to lego. The flange has to be glued to the motor and the axle adapter to the shaft. I made this to recreate the way Lego Technic kits with motors worked like in the early 80s. You had to create gearboxes with extreme gear ratios to make those early virtually torque-less motors (4.5v) work. The design of the RC-car i posted shows one way to make this work.
