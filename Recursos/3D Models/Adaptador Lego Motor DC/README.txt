28BYJ-48 stepper motor to LEGO axel by laszewski on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2188562

Summary:
IntroductionGregor von LaszewskiYou will be able to create an adapter between the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a LEGO axel. As it turns out this part is quite dependent on the printer and its setting and thus you will probably have to adjust it for your printer. Thus the model needs to be modified. To do so you will need OpenSCAD on your computer and download the scad model and modify. You will do this in two phases.Phase 1: Find approximate parameters via test printsThe SCAD contains a number of variables. To set it in testing mode usefinal = false;Now you can adjust the parameters for the LEGO attachmentaxis_wcross the width of LEGO crossaxis_wbeam the widht of a tiny section that builds the crossTo change the values for the stepper motor usemotor_width which is the width of the square to the stepper motormotor_length which is the length of the square to the stepper motorFind some values that will work. If one of the test is successful, you can switch it of by using eithercross_test = false;oraxil_test = false;Whenever, you make a change, make sure to press the Render F6 button before exporting and saving the model. This assures you get the newest model exported.Phase 2: Finalize the print and parametersOnce you found suitable values, you need to finalize. This is needed because printing a larger model behaves slightly different due to cooling differences.Set the variablefinal = true;and print. If you need adjustments just do it as you have done precviously while adjusting the parameters. Do only print one item at a time. As you will get different behaviour if you print multiple due to different cooling behaviour.Once you are satisfied. Safe the settings and print one adapter at a time.OutlookUnfortunately I could not find nice tires for the stepper motor, otherwise I would not have done this. However, LEGO tires are readily available. WIth this I am no able to create a new 2WD Robot Car platform to demonstrate usage ofesp8266arduinoraspberry PI 3Once I have setteled on a base and atatched the motors I hope to update you.PrinterI have a davinci mini makerhttp://us.store.xyzprinting.com/us_en/catalog/printer/daVinciminiMakerYou will be able to create an adapter between the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a LEGO axel.
