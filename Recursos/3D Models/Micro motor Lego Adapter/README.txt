N20 Lego/Technic Motor adapter - Tinkr Remix by TinkrBeard on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5318281

Summary:
This is a quick remix, as at he time of making this the original STL had the axel adapter IN the main bracket, meaning it was solid when printed.This is exactly the same model, except I have opened in in SCAD and removed the axel adapter.So all credit to the original designer!Cheers,Tinkr.
