Lego Compatible DC TT Hobby Motor Mount & Axle Adapter by bpratt107 on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5140209

Summary:
Remix of standard servo mount to allow lego compatible pieces to fit on standard yellow DC TT hobby motor with gearbox. Good for hobbiest robotics projects. I use it in my High School robotics class to connect the microbit/raspberri pi to lego technic pieces for prototypes. Axle adapter is DC motor shaft to cross hole.
